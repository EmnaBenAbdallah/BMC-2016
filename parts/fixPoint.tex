The study of basins of attraction provides an important understanding of the different behaviors of a Biological Regulatory Network (BRN)~\cite{wuensche1998genomic}.
Indeed, a system will always eventually end in a basin of attraction,
and this may depend on biological switches or other complex phenomena.
Here we focus on fixed points (also called stable states or steady states),
which are basins of attraction composed of only one state. \\

\subsection{Process Hitting translation in ASP}
Before any analysis of the network,
we first need to translate it into ASP\footnote{All programs, including this translation and the methods described in the following, are available online at: \url{https://github.com/EmnaBenAbdallah/verification-of-dynamical-properties_PH}}.
To do this we use the self-describing predicates
\texttt{sort}, \texttt{process} and \texttt{action} to define the sorts, processes and actions of the network, respectively.
\pref{ex:asp-ph} shows how a PH network is defined with these predicates.

\begin{example}[Representation of a PH model in ASP]
\label{ex:asp-ph}
The representation of the PH model of \pref{fig:ph} in ASP as the following:
\begin{lstlisting}
process("a", 0..1). process("b", 0..2). process("c", 0..1). %\label{ASPprocess1}
process("d", 0..1).  process("e", 0..2). %\label{ASPprocess2}
sort(X) :- process(X,_). %\label{ASPsort}
action("d",1,"d",1,0). action("d",0,"a",0,1). %\label{actions1}
action("a",1,"c",1,"b",0,1). action("a",1,"b",1,"e",0,1). %\label{actions2}
\end{lstlisting}
In \refll{ASPprocess1}{ASPprocess2} we create the list of processes corresponding to each sort.
For example the sort \texttt{"a"} has 2 processes numbered \texttt{0} and \texttt{1};
predicate ``\texttt{process("a", 0..1).}'' will in fact expand into the two following predicates:
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none]
process("a", 0). process("a", 1).
\end{lstlisting}
\Refl{ASPsort} enumerates every sort of the network from the previous information.
In ASP, a word starting with a capital letter is a variable,
and the underscore (``\texttt{\_}'') is a placeholder for any value.
Finally, all the actions of the network are defined straightforwardly in \refll{actions1}{actions2};
for instance, the predicate ``\texttt{action("d",0,"a",0,1).}'' represents the action
$\PHfrappe{d_0}{a_0}{a_1}$ and we use the same predicate to define a plural action: ``\texttt{action("a",1,"c",1,"b",0,1)}" to represent the action $\PHfrappe{a_1 \wedge c_1}{b_0}{b_1}$ means that when $a_1$ and $c_1$ are simultanory active, they can cooperate to change the level of $b$ from $0$ to $1$.
\end{example}

			\hspace{0.2cm} \textbf{\textit{return}} $\Delta$		
	\end{itemize}
\end{algorithm}

The enumeration of fixed points requires to translate the definition of a steady state (given in \pref{def:fixpoint})
into logic rules for ASP program. Thus, first we browse all processes of this graph in order to generate all possible states,
that is, all possible combinations of processes by choosing only one process from each sort (\refl{selectprocesses}).
\begin{lstlisting}
1 {selectProc(A,I) : process(A,I)} 1 :- sort(A). %\label{selectprocesses}
\end{lstlisting}
The previous lines form a \emph{cardinality rule} that creates as many potential answer sets as the number of possible states
to take into account.
The next step consists in filtering out any state that is not a \emph{fixed point},
or, in other words, eliminating all candidate answer sets in which an action could be played. For this, we use a constraint:
any solution that satisfies the body of this constraint will be removed from the answer set.
Regarding our problem, a state is eliminated if there exists an action between two selected processes (\refll{constraintFix}{constraintFix2}). The first constraint \refl{constraintFix} treats the action with only one hitter and the second \refl{constraintFix2} the actions with $2$ hitters. We developed so a program that takes into account the maximum indegree of the model and generate constraints as much as necessary.
\begin{lstlisting}
:- action(A,I,B,J,_), selectProc(A,I), selectProc(B,J), A!=B. %\label{constraintFix}
:- action(A1,I1,A2,I2,B,J,_), selectProc(A1,I1),selectProc(A2,I2), 
      selectProc(B,J), A!=B. %\label{constraintFix2}
\end{lstlisting}
Finally, the fixed points of the considered model are exactly the states represented in each remaining answer,
described by the atoms \texttt{selectProc(A,I)}.

\begin{example}[Fixed points enumeration]
The PH model of \pref{fig:ph} contains $5$ sorts:
$a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ have $2$ processes and $b$ has 3; therefore, the whole model has $2*2*2*3*3 = 72$ states (whether they can be reached or not from a given initial state).
We can check that this model contains exactly $5$ fixed points: $\PHstate{a_1, b_0, c_0, d_0, e_1}$, $\PHstate{a_1, b_2, c_0, d_0, e_1}$, $\PHstate{a_1, b_1, c_0, d_0, e_1}$, $\PHstate{a_1, b_0, c_0, d_0, e_0}$, $\PHstate{a_1, b_2, c_0, d_0, e_0}$.
Indeed, there is no action between each two processes contained in this state so no execution is possible from these. In this example, no other state verifies this property.

If we execute the ASP program detailed above (\refll{selectprocesses}{constraintFix2}),
alongside with the description of the PH model given in \pref{ex:asp-ph} (\refll{ASPprocess1}{actions2}),
we obtain $8$ answer sets that match the expected result:
